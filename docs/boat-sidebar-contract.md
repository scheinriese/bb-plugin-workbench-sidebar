# Boat sidebar state v1

Boat remains independent of Workbench sidebar. Its default-list row status and
metadata remain registered when this consumer is absent.

The consumer uses public `useSdk().plugins.callRpc` with `pluginId: "boat"`,
`method: "sidebarState"`, input `{ "version": 1,
"timezoneOffsetMinutes": new Date().getTimezoneOffset() }`, and the Zod output schema
in `shared/boat-sidebar.ts`. This additive RPC is read-only.

The timezone field is optional, integer, bounded to -840..840, and uses the
JavaScript sign: local time is UTC minus the offset. `{version:1}` remains
valid with the producer's server-local fallback. Berlin winter time is -60.

The response is `{version:1, revision:string, threads:SidebarThreadDto[],
truncated:boolean}`; at most 2000 records. Every record contains:

| Field          | Meaning                                                                    |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| threadId       | Existing BB thread id; never a synthetic sidebar row                       |
| role           | orchestrator, task, review, chat                                           |
| status         | working, review, ready, shipped, needs-you, broken, stopped, waiting-reset |
| provider       | claude, codex or null                                                      |
| secondLine     | `{text,tone}` or null; tone neutral, attention, danger, success            |
| parentThreadId | Existing parent thread id or null                                          |
| createdFor     | `"you"` for plugin-created work, otherwise null                           |
| listedIn       | Listing chat id or null; used when its tasks-started card is seen            |
| moving         | Optional boolean; false suppresses an idle completed turn's activity ring    |
| rollup         | `{needsYou,stopped,ready,working,shippedToday}` or null                    |
| hidden         | Hide from sidebar; preserve host search and other surfaces                 |
| updatedAt      | Timestamp string                                                           |

Unknown added fields are stripped by the v1 schema. Unknown version/status or
malformed responses fall back to generic BB rows. An unavailable, disabled, or
older Boat (including unknown_method) fails quietly without notifications.
The consumer reads once for the list every 3 seconds in the foreground and
30 seconds in the background, aborts on unmount, avoids concurrent requests,
and retains object identity while revision is unchanged.

Workbench uses Boat nesting and hides shipped tasks and retired reviews from
this list. Any parent with seven open direct children gains a rollup and
collapses on its first crossing; subsequent user choices persist. This also
works with no Boat DTOs: the consumer counts public BB children and working
activity, e.g. `18 threads · 3 working`. Hidden/archived children are excluded.
An available Boat summary takes precedence; generic children keep BB order.
Only authentic Boat statuses contribute urgency: needs-you, broken, ready,
working/review, then idle, retaining BB order inside each bucket. Smaller
groups retain BB order. Automatic sorting waits while
the pointer is over the sidebar or a row has keyboard focus. The generic BB
list, search and other plugin row signals continue to work. Second lines
appear for needs-you/broken/ready, a collapsed rollup, and the reviewed
known-reset exception below. Drafts replace the dot;
rollup dot priority is needs-you then broken. Provider identity comes from BB's
public provider catalog, using Boat's provider override when supplied.

Rollup categories are exclusive: paid out-of-memory recovery belongs to
`stopped`, while explicit decisions belong to `needsYou`. Navigation attention
can therefore differ from the sidebar's `needsYou` count. `shippedToday` counts
recorded shipping/merge events, never merely closed native chats. Own demo
validation pins producer commit `d59c397` with these semantics.

Fixture state belongs only in the isolated demo's backend. Product code never
inserts fixture threads or creates Boat work.

Owner-confirmed additive v1 fields: required `createdFor: "you" | null` and
`listedIn: string | null`. New counts are client-side; no rollup.new field.
See [created-for-you rules](new-threads.md).

`moving?: boolean` is an additive field: a task can keep its logical working
status while its latest completed turn is idle. The provider ring runs only
for working/review with moving !== false; older producers without it keep the
v1 behavior. Idle completion is not presented as a stopped sandbox.

A neutral `waiting-reset` second line is shown only when supplied by Boat.
The producer verifies a live public `threads.queue.list` subscription-limit
retry from `provider-retry`, with `payload.kind=retry`, reason `Rate limited`,
state scheduled/waiting, and a future scheduled time. Native thread state
must be idle/error, unarchived and undeleted; moving, attention, ready and
broken work take precedence. Relay quota timestamps and historical events
alone do not establish a pause. No live retry means no reset line.
The line uses #7A7A7A and the normal second-line geometry; the idle ring is
suppressed. `Continued on Codex` remains omitted.

The isolated runtime proof used two genuine queued retry DTOs behind the
verified reject-all `message.dispatch` demo hook. Both rows were removed at
rest after capture. The hook and fixture seeder are demo-only, outside the
distributed product. Evidence: `sidebar-reset-source-proof.json` and
`sidebar-reset-queue-cleanup.json` under build-shots/fidelity.
